# SmartHome Backend DB Server
A scalable MongoDB database and a robust, modular, and production-ready smart home backend system. This system provides APIs for managing users, homes, rooms, devices, device states, sensor data, and emergency actions. It supports scalable and secure data handling using MongoDB, integrated with real-time updates and reliable route validation.

## SmartHome Backend Controllers

This is how the backend for the SmartHomeApp, built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB will look like.
To test controllers you need to import /db folder in your project. Otherwise you can use the routers i created below for testing.

Setup

1. Install Dependencies:
   npm install

2. Configure Environment:
   Use your local DB we have used "smarthome"
   - Create a `.env` file:
     MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/smarthome
     PORT=3000

4. Start MongoDB:
   - Run MongoDB locally (Windows example):
     "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\8.0\bin\mongod.exe"

5. Start Server:
   npm start
   - Expected output: `MongoDB connected` and `Server running on port 3000`.

API Endpoints

Test these endpoints using Postman or a similar tool.

Testing Tips
- MongoDB Compass: Use to view changes in the `smarthome` database (`homes`, `users`, `devices` collections).
- MongoDB Shell: Query with:
  use smarthome
  db.devices.find({ _id: ObjectId("any id") })
Notes
- Passwords are stored in plain textâ€”add hashing (e.g., bcrypt) for production.
- Authentication (e.g., JWT) is not yet implemented.
- Ensure MongoDB is running before starting the server.
